# Governance Protocol (V3)

This page serves as the canonical placeholder for the Governance layer of the CastQuest V3 Protocol.

It exists to satisfy internal references from:
- `v3/protocol/ai-dao-constitution.md`
- other V3 governance documents

## Purpose

The Governance Protocol defines:
- decision‑making flows  
- proposal lifecycle  
- voting mechanisms  
- authority boundaries  
- upgrade paths  
- treasury oversight  
- emergency powers and fail‑safes  

## Status

This document is intentionally minimal.  
It will be expanded in future PRs as the full Governance Spec is finalized.

## Link Integrity

This file ensures that VitePress no longer reports a dead link for:

`/v3/protocol/governance`

and allows the documentation site to build successfully in CI.
